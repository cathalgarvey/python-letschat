# Python-LetsChat (letschat on PyPI)
by Cathal Garvey, Copyright 2015, released under GNU Affero General Public License (see HACKING)

This is an API wrapper written for Lets-Chat in Python. It offers high-level
conveniences for connecting to and interacting with a Lets-Chat server, including
reading, posting, uploading and downloading files, and querying user data. It could
form the foundation of a neat Python bot for Lets-Chat, or as an adaptor for
providing integration services at server-side.

It's still a work-in-progress but most of the critical stuff is working as intended,
and I'd consider it useful as-is. However, the "API of the API" is not yet frozen,
and future pushes to this repo may further integrate the output of methods to wrap
server data in higher-level abstractions.. So, caveat emptor for another 48 hours or
so.

Enjoy!
